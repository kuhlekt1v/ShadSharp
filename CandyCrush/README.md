# Candy Crush: Challenges

## Modify the game as follows:

1. Add a click counter to calculate # of turns it takes to fill the whole board.
2. Determine when the user wins the game. All tiles should have the same color. Display a messagebox with a winning message.
3. Change the total number of colors displayed on the board. Client thinks there are too many different colors on the board so the game gets boring.
4. On every Nth turn, randomly choose a tile and change it's color just to frustrate the player. Set the value of N to your liking.
