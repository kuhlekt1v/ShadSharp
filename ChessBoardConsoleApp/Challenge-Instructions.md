# Challenge
The program works but is not yet finished. Here are some things you need to complete.
## 1. Fix Out-of-bounds errors.
The function to mark the legal moves will cause errors. Your job is to check to see if an item in the grid array actually exists before you try to reference it.
## 2. Fix Input errors.
The user is supposed to type in a number between 1 and 8 when asked to place a piece on the board. If she/he tries to put in letters or numbers outside of the acceptable range, the program will crash. Verify the input from the user before proceeding with the rest of the program.
## 3. Multiple pieces.
The program is only designed to work with the knight chess piece. Modify the program so it asks which piece should be placed on the board and then give the correct legal moves for that piece.
## 4. Board printing upgrade.
The program shows only a single character for each board cell. Modify the output to print a board outline like the example shown below.
