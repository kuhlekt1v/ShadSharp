# Whack-A-Mole: Challenges

## Modify the game as follows:

1. Keep score of the number of hits on the target button.
2. Decide what will happen if the player clicks on the form instead of the button (missed click)? Should you end the game? Subtract points? Lose a life? You decide.
3. Modify the appearance of the buttons with colors, fonts, and background images. Instead of a TARGET button, you could perform the same effect with a picture control.
4. Determine how the game will end. Does the game end after 60 seconds? After 50 hits? After 3 misses? You decide.
5. Create a "Play Again" button that shows when the game is over. Keep a high score from previous games played.
6. Form the time on Label1 to make it more visually appealing.
7. Create a second button title "Don't click me!" or "False TARGET". Use it as a decoy or "bomb" that damages the player's game in some way.
8. Increase difficulty. Does the TARGET button get faster or smaller when the score gets higher? Perhaps there are more decoy buttons to avoid.
9. Level features. Multiple levels of difficult to clear could have background scenery changes. Can a player earn extra lives?
